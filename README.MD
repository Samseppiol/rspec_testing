##### Doing an rspec course on lynda.com. I have previously used rails inbuilt testing for my term two project but want to check out rspec as well.


## Rspec Hierarchy:
##### Spec File E.g: car_spec.rb
##### example group E.g: describe
##### nested group E.g: describe/context
##### example E.g: it
##### expectations E.g expect().to()
